test scenes for concave and convex mirrors
mirror_planar
mirror_convex
mirror_concave

the reference scene have a quad rotated towards the mirror center.
the impostor versions use an impostor instead (therefore, the rotation of the non-mirrored quad changes)

General Measurements:
distance to mirror center: 2 units
vector to quad/impostor center (2, 2)
